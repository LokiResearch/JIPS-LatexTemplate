## Compilation

You have to use `lualatex` to compile (pdflatex cannot work).
`xelatex` can also work, but with minor bugs and differences.

## Overleaf

The template is also available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jips-journal-dinteraction-personne-systeme/rhtrrqyfspbg).
Note that the Overleaf template uses the ```Liberation Sans``` font instead of the ```Arial``` font.
