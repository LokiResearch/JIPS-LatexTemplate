\section{Maths}

$$E=mc^2$$

In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.

Depending on the value of $x$ the equation \( f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{a_i}{1+x} \) may diverge or converge.

\[ f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{a_i}{1+x} \]
